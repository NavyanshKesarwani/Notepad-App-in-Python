# Notepad in Python
It is an application made using Python, that allows you to add your notes and other texts into the text area and save it. It has a simple Graphical User Interface and allows user to freely create a new file or import an existing file from his/her system.

## What Libraries are required for this application
To make this project using Python, you're required to install the Tkinter library. You can install this library in Python entering the following command in your command-line terminal:
```bash
pip install tkinter
```
Apart from Tkinter, I have also used the 'os' library of Python, which is required to perform all the basic tasks that can be done on a basic application window like closing, minimizing etc. It is pre-installed in Python. So we just have to import it into our project.
## What does Tkinter do in this application
Tkinter library is mainly used for making Graphical User Interfaces in Python. In this project, Tkinter library is used to create the window of the application, along with the the menu bar and the text area of the Notepad.
